        <p>As a new developer I don't have much in the way of projects to display. I'm interested in creating many things. Things that connect people, but not in a superficial way like the social media that exists today. I want to connect people to the food around them. To the physical world around them, the flora and fauna. I'm not sure how interested I am in "front-end" devlopement -  have a good eye for aesthetics but I am definitely more interested in making things work behind the scenes. Anyway, this a API I made at Ada, it's like Blockbuster, but not at all. </p>

        <a class="workslink" href="https://www.wanderinggoatmassage.com"> <h3>thai massage.</h3>
        </a>

        <p>Outside of programming, I am deeply interested in Thai Massage and Thai medicine. It's something I am looking forward to coming back to when it is no longer attached to my means of living. I think it is something that should be available to everyone regardless of income. That being said, people should pay what they're able to according to their income. Thai massage is a branch of traditional Thai medicine that is a holistic and meditative style of bodywork. Itâ€™s foundations lie in Thai medicinal theory and Buddhism; so while it has the potential to treat injuries and/or restructure body alignment, it also integrates a deep spiritual component based on the idea that the mental, energetic, emotional, and physical bodies are not separate.

        <a class="workslink" href="https://soundcloud.com/gigibeaux/hald-dazed"><h3>a song i made once.</h3></a>
        <a href="https://soundcloud.com/gigibeaux/hald-dazed"><img class="worksicons gigi" src="../images/soundcloud.png"></a>
        <p>I think I'd consider myself a creative person but rarely follow through with creative endeavors. I think mostly making excuses to not have to put in the work/be with myself. Whenever I DO create something I figure it was a fluke so never try and make anything again. I don't know, it's confusing and I feel frustrated about this tendency at times. This is stupid song I wrote 6 years ago when I thought I'd be a white rapper... yikes! </p>
